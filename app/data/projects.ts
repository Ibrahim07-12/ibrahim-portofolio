  longDescription: "This project develops an automatic door system designed to enhance room comfort and security using ultrasonic sensors and MQ-2 gas sensors, with fuzzy logic algorithm as the main controller. The ultrasonic sensor detects objects approaching the door - when objects are â‰¥ 30 cm away, the door remains closed; at 20 cm, the door begins to open; and at 10 cm, the door fully opens. Simultaneously, the MQ-2 gas sensor monitors smoke density for safety. When smoke levels are â‰¤ 2800 ppm (safe category), the door follows the ultrasonic sensor logic. However, if smoke levels reach â‰¥ 3350 ppm (danger category), the door automatically opens fully to provide evacuation access. The system implements fuzzy logic to deliver adaptive responses based on sensor data, ensuring efficient and flexible door operation according to different situations. This project delivers an automation technology solution that is not only intelligent but also prioritizes safety aspects.",

  longDescription: "This project implements adaptive PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control to regulate fan speed in real-time based on air quality conditions. An MQ-2 sensor is used to detect the presence of gas or potential hazards in the air, with a fan as the primary actuator. When the sensor detects dangerous gases, the PID controller automatically increases the fan speed to eliminate the gas and improve ventilation. Conversely, if no dangerous gases are detected or air quality improves, the PID controller adjusts the fan speed to a lower level to save energy, while still ensuring a safe and comfortable environment. The system provides an energy-efficient solution for maintaining optimal air quality in various environments.",
